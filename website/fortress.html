<P>Since this region is composed of 45-45-90 triangles, there are two types
of tiles. One is formed by putting two triangles together by their hypotenuses,
a square is formed. Putting two triangles together by their legs will form
a larger 45-45-90 triangle. Since some of the vertices project eight edges,
fortresses converge much slower than simpler regions like Aztec Diamonds
and Hexagons. However, once randomized, a fortress seems to exhibit behavior
like that of an Aztec Diamond. The arctic boundary, however, is not believed
to be circular and is still being researched. This may prove for challenging
that the Aztec Diamond and Hexagon since large samples are difficult to
produce and its shape is most likely more complex.</P>

<P>Note: by clicking the applet and scrolling the wheel on your mouse you can adjust the pace of randomization.</P>
