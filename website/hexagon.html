<P>For a description of the randomization process, refer to the <A HREF="propp-wilson.html">Propp-Wilson</A>
Algorithm page.</P>

<P>A hexagon is unique in that it has a very apparent height function.
While it takes a trained eye to visualize the height function of an Aztec
Diamond, raising and lowering moves of a hexagon can be viewed as adding
or removing a cube from a box. The minimum tiling (with height zero) corresponds
to an empty box, while the maximum tiling has a height equal to the number
of cubes inside it. To see this, pause the randomization by clicking on
the applet and compare the number of apparent cubes with the height. Like
the Aztec Diamond, brickwork will form in the corners while the circular
region will seem fairly random.</P>

<P>Note: by clicking the applet and scrolling the wheel on your mouse you can adjust the pace of randomization.</P>
