<P>Above, a random order 16 Aztec Diamond is being created using the <A HREF="propp-wilson.html">Propp-Wilson
Algorithm</A>. What made the Aztec Diamond so popular was the circular
arctic boundary that appeared in random samples. This boundary seperates
the brickwork in the corners of the diamond from the variable center. Notice
how in the tilings above, each started with perfect brickwork covering
the region in two opposite phases. In this case, the four phases are characterized
by their orientation (horizontal or vertical) and whether their top-left
face covered a black or white face of the region. However, as rotations
occur, brickwork forms in each corner. Why? Consider what happens if this
were not true. If two vertical tiles were placed at the top of the diamond,
on each side would be a square with only one neighbor. As a result, a tile
is forced there. Extending this, it can be seen that this single change
forces all the tiles along the top boundaries, creating in effect and Aztec
Diamond of a smaller order. After further investigation, the arctic boundary
was proved to be circular for arbitarily large regions. This insighted
searches for the other regions with similar properties. One of these is
the hexagon, the next example.</P>

<P>The other thing that makes Aztec Diamonds popular is the fact that the
number of tilings equals exactly 2 ^ ( n(n+1)/2 ), where n represents the
order of the diamond. Curiously the exponent equals the number of faces
in one corner (or tiles in one half) of the region. The reason why this
is so unusual is the fact that most regions, even common checkerboard shaped
regions, have unusual numbers of tilings with seemingly random prime factors.
Regions with &quot;nice&quot; numbers of possible tilings like this are
also being searched for today.</P>

<P>Note: by clicking the applet and scrolling the wheel on your mouse you can adjust the pace of randomization.</P>
